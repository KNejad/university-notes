  - It cannot be simplified
3: This cannot be answered because it hasn't been stated what is required for us to pass. If we assume green means pass and red means don't pass then its pretty easy. But there could be more exceptions like, if there is a pedestrian, if there is a car crossing etc.
4:
  a: 1 - (10/20)^2 - (10/20)^2 = 0.5
  b: The GINI index for each Customer ID is `1 - (1/1)^2 = 0`. So the overall GINI index is `(20 * 0)/20 = 0`
  c:
    M: 1 - (6/10)^2 - (4/10)^2 = 0.48
    F: 1 - (6/10)^2 - (4/10)^2 = 0.48
    GINI Index: (10/20)*0.48 + (10/20)*0.48 = 0.48
  d:
    Family: 1 - (1/4)^2 - (3/4)^2 = 0.375
    Sports: 1 - (8/8)^2 - (0/8)^2 = 0
    Luxury: 1 - (1/8)^2 - (7/8)^2 = 0.21875
    GINI Index: (8/20)*0 + (4/20)*0.375 + (8/20)*0.21875 = 0.1625
  e:
    Small: 1 - (3/5)^2 - (2/5)^2 = 0.48
    Medium: 1 - (3/7)^2 - (4/7)^2 = 0.4898
    Large: 1 - (2/4)^2 - (2/4)^2 = 0.5
    Extra Large: 1 - (2/4)^2 - (2/4)^2 = 0.5
    GINI Index: (5/20)*0.48 + (7/20)*0.4898 + (4/20)*0.5 + (4/20)*0.5 = 0.4914
  f: Car type has the most predictive power
  g: Since each new member will get a new ID it cannot hold any predictive power
