Logical Agent: A system which uses knowledge about the world to make decisions
Fuzzy logic: Logic where things aren't boolean and instead can have a degree of truth. (For example somebody with £1M is rich and somebody with £0.9M is still rich but less so)
Forward chaining: Start from the facts and draw any possible conclusions
Backward chaining: Move backwards from a goal to get to the facts. If the facts hold true then you have proven the goal
Satisfiability: A sentence is satisfiable if it is true in some models
Validity: A sentence is valid if it is true in all models
