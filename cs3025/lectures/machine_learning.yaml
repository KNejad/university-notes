Inductive learning: Learning by examples (supervised learning)
Decision tree:
  Description: Contains all attributes required to make a decision. By answering each attribute you get to a final decision (e.g. is it raining?)
  Discriminating attributes: The attributes which provides the most input as to what the final decision will be (e.g. one option could have all options leading to a "yes" decision)
  GINI index:
    Description: Can be used to find the most discriminating attribute
    Formula for each attribute: 1 -  (count(option_a)/count(all_options))^2 - (count(option_b)/count(all_options))^2...
Incremental learning:
  Description: Learns incrementally by new examples. Does not need to retrain the entire model when new examples are added
  Version space: The model used for classifying an item
  Steps:
    - Start off with our first positive example being the version space
    - If a new example gives the expected output then do nothing
    - Otherwise add/adjust information in the version space to fit the new pattern
  Candidate elimination algorithm: Maintains the most general and specialising case and adjusts one of them on each new input until both are identical
