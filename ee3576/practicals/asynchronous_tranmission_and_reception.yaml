a:
  Binary: 0100011 (least signifant bit was first)
  Decimal: 1 + 2 + 32 = 35
  ASCII: "#"
  Parity: Even parity bit
b:
  Binary: 01001011 (least significant bit was first)
  Hexadecimal: 0x4B
  ASCII: K
c:
  Binary: 01101010
  Sequence: __-_-_--_--
  Time required: 11/4800 seconds
  Bandwidth: (assuming first harmonic) Baudrate = 2 * bandwidth * log2(1) => baudrate/2 = bandwidth => 4800/2 = 2.4Khz
