Baud: Each signal change on the cable (low or high)
Differential transmission: 2 twisted cables which send opposite signals. Any noise will affect both cables and will cancel each other out
Hamming distance: The minimum number of random errors which must occur in order to go undetected by the check sum
Parity bit: A final bit used to ensure the integrity of a message. This is done by setting the parity bit to a value which would make there be an even number of 0s
Receiver hysteresis: When reading a voltage input as 0 or 1, have a no-go zone which is read as neither high nor low
Stub: A diversion of the main cable. If reflected then this can cause 2 signals which interfere
Termination: A plug at the end of a cable with a resistor connecting to ground in order to reduce noise by preventing the signal from reflecting
Variac: Variable autotransformer. 2 coils which depending on how much they overlap more power is passed through
Watchdog: An ISR which keeps track of the program and restarts it if it fails
