Characteristics:
  - Bus for communication
  - Differential twisted pair
  - Clock synchronises itself by the changes in signal being sent
  - Signal of 1 sets both cables to 2.5 volts
  - Signal of 0 sets 1 cable to 1.5 volts and the other to 3.5 volts
Bit stuffing: To prevent the clock from losing accuracy, after every 5 bits sent with the same value, one bit of the opposite value is added
Data transmission:
  - All devices can initiate communication with other devices arbitrarily
  - Sending a signal of 1 is recessive which means it will be overpowered by a signal of 0
  - If a device receives a signal of 0 when it sent a signal of 1, then there are other devices sending data so it "drops out"
  - Eventually only 1 device will remain which is sending data
Checksum calculation: To calculate the checksum, the modulo operation is used on the data
Frame format:
  - Start of Frame (1b) = 0
  - Message ID (11b for CAN 2.0A)
  - Control fields (3b)
  - Data Length (4b)
  - Data (0-64b)
  - CRC (15b)
  - ACK fields (3b)
  - End of Frame Delimiter (7b)
CAN Formats: By changing the start code we can signal to newer devices to use a different format.
CAN Flexible data: In CAN-FD format more data to be sent in a single frame
