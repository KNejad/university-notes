Characteristics:
  - Bus for communication
  - Differential twisted pair
  - Clock synchronises itself by the changes in signal being sent
Bit stuffing: To prevent the clock from losing accuracy, after every 5 bits sent with the same value, one bit of the opposite value is added
Data transmission:
  - All devices can initiate communication with other devices arbitrarily
  - Sending a signal of 1 is recessive which means it will be overpowered by a signal of 0
  - If a device receives a signal of 0 when it sent a signal of 1, then there are other devices sending data so it "drops out"
  - Eventually only 1 device will remain which is sending data
Checksum calculation: To calculate the checksum, the modulo operation is used on the data
CAN Formats: By changing the start code we can signal to newer devices to use a different format.
CAN Flexible data: In CAN-FD format more data to be sent in a single frame
