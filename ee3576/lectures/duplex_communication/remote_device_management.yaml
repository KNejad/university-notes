Half duplex: Only 1 device can communicate with the other at a time
Discovering devices:
  Description: Essentially do a binary tree search on the UID range to find the devices. This is because if there are multiple responses there will be noise
  Pseudocode: |
    discover_devices(range = all) {
      mute_all_devices
      devices = send_signal_to(range)
      if (devices.length == 1) {
        add_device_to_list
      }

      if (devices.length > 1) {
        discover_devices(first_half_of_range)
        discover_devices(second_half_of_range)
      }
    }
