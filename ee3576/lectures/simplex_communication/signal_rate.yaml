Ideal channel bandwidth: An ideal channel can have an infinite bandwidth
Harmonics: Each harmonic allows for an extra signal which can be sent over the cable (e.g. up to 3rd harmonic at 500Hz is a bandwidth of 1500Hz)
Shannon capacity:
  Decription: The maximum capacity which a transmission line can handle given its frequency
  Formula: C = Hz * log2(1 + signal_to_noise_ratio)
