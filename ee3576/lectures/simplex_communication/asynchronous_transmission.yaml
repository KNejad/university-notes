Baud:
  Description: Each signal change on the cable (low or high)
  Baud rate: The number of signal changes that occur per second
Slot:
  Description: The set of bauds that carry a byte of data
  Format:
    - Arbitrary idle gap (mark high)
    - 1 start baud: Signals the start of a new message
    - Data: Least significant bit first
    - 2 stop bauds: Prevents mistiming between the receiver and transmitter which could cause the receiver to read a byte from the next message
Benefits:
  - Common standard
  - Only needs two wires
  - Simple UART implementation, no clock recovery, no DPLL
Drawbacks:
  - Lower efficiency
  - Poor error detection
  - Rate limited by clock stability, cable quality, distance, etc.
