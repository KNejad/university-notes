Description: An accounting of all of the gains and losses from the transmitter to the receiver
Free space path loss: The loss of signal between two antennas in a given range
Isotropic antenna: Signal radiates equally in all directions of both planes
Omni-directional antenna: Signal radiates equally all directions of one plane
Directional antenna: Signal radiates more in a specific direction
Link budget calculation:
  Formula: Prx = Ptx + Gtx - Ltx -Lfs -Lm + Grx - Lrx
  Key variables:
    Prx: Received power (dBm)
    Ptx: Transmitter output power (dBm)
    Gtx: Transmitter antenna gain (dBi)
    Ltx: Transmitter cable (dB/m x distance) (dB)
    Lfs: Free space loss or path loss (dB)
    Lm: Fade margin (dB)
    Grx: Receiver antenna gain (dBi)
    Lrx: Receiver cable (dB/m x distance) (dB)
