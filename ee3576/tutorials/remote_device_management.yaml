a:
  - The line driver needs to support transit and receive
  - Any repeaters need to support half duplex
  - The bus needs to be terminated on both ends
b:
  - The controller initiates communication with a remote device and then switches to "receive" mode
  - The remote device recognises the signal and if it was addressed then it enables its own transmitter
  - Once data has been sent the remote device switches back to receive mode and the controller resumes operation
