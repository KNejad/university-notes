b: The receiver listens to 4 addresses 6,7,8,9 it will look at slot 7 to get the value from the 2nd channel
c: ../laboratories/dmx_triac_power_control/
Additional thoughts:
  i: "returni" signals to the microcontroller to return from the interrupt
  ii: Yes I can. "gDmxState" is used to store the state
  iii: Because we are changing gDmxState but we don't want to lose track of what state we are currently in during this interrupt
