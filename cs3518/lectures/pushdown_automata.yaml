Description: Like an NDFSA but there is a stack which we can add/remove symbols to. It recognises CFGs
Tuple representation:
  Q: States
  Σ: Alphabet
  Γ: Stack characters
  δ: State/stack transition table
  q1: Starting state
  F: Final states
Stack: PAs use a stack to keep track of the state. Symbols can be added to or removed from the top of the stack
Transition format: input_string, char_to_read_from_stack/char_to_write_to_stack
