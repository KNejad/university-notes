Tuple definition:
  Q: Set of states
  Σ: Alphabet without "␣"
  Γ: Tape alphabet
  δ: Transition function of the form "Q x Γ → Q x Γ x {L,R}". As in, given a state and a letter on the tape, transition to another state, write a character from Γ to the tape and then move either 1 position to the left or right
  q0: Start state
  qaccept: Single accept state
  qreject: Single reject state
Tape: The tape of a turing machine is infinite, however it does have a start. If it is told to go left of the start it will ignore the input
Representation of current state: "<tape_element>*<current_state><tape_element>*". The tape position will be the character to the right of <current_state>
Turing decidable language: Any language where all inputs will cause a turing machine to accept or reject (not enter a loop)
