Context free grammar: Given a start variable, it recursivly replaces all occureences of a variable with other variables and/or characters to produce any number of strings
Ambiguous CFGs: When there are multiple ways of generating the same string
Terminals: These characters are final and not replaced
Format: Multiple "LHS → RHS" rules where each LHS is replaced with RHS
Parse trees: Visual representation of the expansion rules which have been used to generate a string
4-tuple representation:
  V: Variables
  Σ: Terminals
  R: Rules
  S: Start variable ∈ V
Chomsky Normal Form:
  Description: A form of CFGs which restricts the number of rules
  Allowed rules:
    - Only the start variable can have the start variable on the RHS
    - Only the start variable can have "ε" transitions
    - Each RHS has either 2 non terminals or only terminals
