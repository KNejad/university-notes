Context free grammar: Given a start variable, it recursivly replaces all occureences of a variable with other variables and/or characters to produce any number of strings
Pushdown automata: Recognises CFG strings and determines if they are valid
Terminals: These characters are final and not replaced
Format: Multiple "LHS -> RHS" rules where each LHS is replaced with RHS
Parse trees: Visual representation of the expansion rules which have been used to generate a string
4-tuple representation:
  V: Variables
  Σ: Terminals
  R: Rules
  S: Start variable ∈ V
