Description: Similar to CFLs but the left hand side of a rule can include patterns with terminals and non terminal symbols
Linear-bounded automata: An automata which can check if strings belong to context sensitive languages. Like a PDA but instead of a stack there is a finite tape where we can access elements without removing the top element
Tuple definition:
  Q: Set of states
  Σ: Input alphabet
  Γ: Tape alphabet which is Σ ∪ { →, ←, ␣ }
  δ: Transition function
