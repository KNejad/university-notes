Linear-bounded automata:
  Description: An automata which can check if strings belong to context sensitive languages. Like a PDA but instead of a stack there is a finite tape where we can access elements without removing the top element
  Tuple definition:
    Q: Set of states
    Σ: Input alphabet
    Γ: Tape alphabet which is Σ ∪ { →, ←, ␣ }
    δ: Transition function
    q0: Initial state
    F: Final state
  Final state difference from PDAs: As soon as an LBA reaches a final state it stops
  Non-contracting: ???
