  Rules:
    S: [ABSBC, e]
    BA: AB
    BB: bb
    CB: BC
    cC: cc
    bC: bc
    Ab: ab
    Aa: aa
    Bb: bb
  Proof:
    - From S we will always have an equal number of A and C but twice the number of Bs
    - All transitions which convert variables to other varibles result in A before B and B before C
    - The only way to get a terminal symbol is by converting BB to bb
    - All As can be converted to 'a' only if they are before a 'b'
    - Al Cs can be converted to 'c' only if they are after a 'b'
    - Finally Bs can be converted to 'b' only if they are next to another 'b'. Thus all 'b's will be next to each other
