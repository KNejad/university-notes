'1':
  Task:
  - You will be given an envelope with pieces of paper containing short descriptions
    of museum items. If you miss the practical, and want to do this at home, here
    are the museum items (docx) to cut up into item cards.
  - Divide the cards into groups of cards that belong together (the card sorting technique
    explained in the lecture). You can decide yourself how many groups to make. If
    you want, you can put an item into multiple groups.
  - Label each resulting group (i.e. give it a descriptive name).
  - Download the results sheet (doc), and put your results in the table.
  Solution: One possible solution is to sort them into art, jewellery, weaponry and
    useful stuff
'2':
  Task:
  - Now get to together with another pair/trio.
  - Compare the groupings you have made. Which items did you all put together in a
    group? How do your groups differ?
  - 'Try to come to an agreement on groupings and label them. Put your results in
    the group table of the results sheet. (NOTE: I would be quite interested to see
    your results. If you want to share them with me, email your results sheet document
    to j.masthoff@abdn.ac.uk)'
  Solution: The other group sorted by region and we played a game where we would randomly
    oick a card from our category and see how long it took them to find it in theirs
