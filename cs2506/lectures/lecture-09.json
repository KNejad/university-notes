	"Heuristic evaluation": "Usability experts judge whether each element of a user interface follows established usability principles",
	"Nielsenâ€™s Heuristics": {
		"Definition": "A set of heuristics for determining usability of a system",
		"Heuristics": {
			"Visibility of system status": "The system should always keep users informed about what is going on",
			"Recognition rather than recall": "Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible",
			"Consistency and standards": "Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing",
			"Aesthetic and minimalist design": "Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed",
			"Match the real world": "The system should speak the user's language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user",
			"User control": "Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked 'emergency exit' to leave the unwanted state",
			"Flexibility and efficiency of use": "Accelerators may speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users",
			"Error prevention": "Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place",
			"Helpful errors": "Error messages should precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution",
			"Help and documentation": "It may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search and list concrete steps to be carried out"
