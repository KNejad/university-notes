# MacOS gets less viruses than Windows computers when used by average users

# Definitions

## Average User

An average user is a user from the general population without expert knowledge (e.g. no computer scientists)

# Material

* 100 Mac computers which have been under regular use by everyday people
* 100 Windows computers which have been under regular use by everyday people

# Subjects

We will not have subjects but we will need to get access to peoples computers.
This can be done by offering free virus scans and removals to people who bring their computers in.

The issues with this approach is that we will may get a biased sample since this will include mostly people who are less knowledgeable about computer security.

We could also ask people online to run a specific anti-virus software and report on the number of viruses found.

# Procedure

Once we get access to the computers needed we can run a specific anti virus software which exists for both platforms and keep track of the number of viruses detected.

We will first however have to ask a questionnaire to make sure we don't get experts.

Then we will calculate the average number of viruses for each platform which will let us determine if our hypothesis is true.
