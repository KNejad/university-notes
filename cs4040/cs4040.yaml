Title: Research Methods
Description: Does this new algorithm improve query performance? Will this protocol ensure our system is robust to attack? How does response time vary with server load? Understanding behaviour – the performance of a task by a computing system in an environment – is critical in both industrial and scientific practice. In this course, you will conduct an individual research project into the behaviour of a computing system. You will develop knowledge and understanding of rigorous methods to: explore computing system behaviour; identify questions about behaviour; design experiments to answer those questions; analyse experimental results; and report on the outcomes of your research.
