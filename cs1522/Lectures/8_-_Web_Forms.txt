<option value="value name" disabled selected> item name </option> disables means you can't select it and selected means its the pre selected option. Option goes in the select tag

<label for="id-of-radio-button">words</label>

to make sure a field is set you can validate it client side with Javascript, Jquery or with a required tag or  server side with php etc
you should use all of them because users can edit the client side stuff. required tag is only supported in HTML 5. Use client side so that bandwidth isn't wasted sending data back and forth.
