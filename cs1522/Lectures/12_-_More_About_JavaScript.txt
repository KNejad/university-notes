====== 12 - More About JavaScript ======
Created Tuesday 23 February 2016

JavaScript in the header is run every time so don't put code there unless its needed because it wastes resources

JavaScript in external files are put in the header. These can be cached so the browser keeps it and doesn't have to load it every time

JavaScript is an Object Oriented Programming language

===== Minification: =====
	Reduces the size of a script (by removing formatting like tabs etc) in order to reduce the load size (can save 50%)
