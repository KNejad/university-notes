Document Object Model: Magically manipulating web page content on the fly

Everything in an HTML document is a node:
-----------------------------------------
 The entire document is a document node
 Every HTML element is an element node
 The text in the HTML elements are text nodes
 Every HTML attribute is an attribute node
 Comments are comment nodes


### Parent,  child, and sibling terms describe the relationships:
In a node tree, the top node is called the root
Every node, except the root, has exactly one parent node
A node can have any number of children
A leaf is a node with no children
Siblings are nodes with the same parent
