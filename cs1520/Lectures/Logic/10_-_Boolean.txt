===== Boolean Axioms: =====
	 {{./pasted_image001.png}}
	#A2  0=1 supposed to be 0=1' and 1=0 is supposed to be 1=0'


===== Boolean Theorems: =====
	{{./pasted_image002.png}}
	#T5 is supposed to be B * B' and B + B'


===== Boolean Theorems of Several Variables: =====

===== Bubble Pushing: =====
	Bubble pushing is a technique to apply De Morgan's theorem directly to a logic diagram.

===== Sum-of-Products (SOP): =====
	All equations can be written in SOP form
	Each truth table row has a minterm
	A minterm is a product (AND) of input variables
	Each minterm is TRUE for that row (and only that row)
	Form function by ORing minterms where the output is TRUE 
	Thus, a sum (OR) of products (AND terms)
	{{./pasted_image007.png}}
	Y = F(A, B) = A'B + AB = Σ(1, 3)


===== Product-of-Sums (POS): =====
	All Boolean equations can be written in POS form
	Each truth table row has a maxterm
	A maxterm is a sum (OR) of literals
	Each maxterm is FALSE for that row (and only that row)
	Form function by ANDing the maxterms for which the output is FALSE
	Thus, a product (AND) of sums (OR terms)
	{{./pasted_image008.png}}
	Y = F(A, B) = (A + B)(A' + B) = Π(0, 2)
