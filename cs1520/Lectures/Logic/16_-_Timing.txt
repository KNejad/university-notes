====== 16 - Timing ======
Created Friday 11 March 2016

===== Terms: =====
	Setup time: t_{setup} = time before clock edge data must be stable (i.e. not changing)
	Hold time: t_{hold} = time after clock edge data must be stable
	Aperture time: t_{a} = time around clock edge data must be stable (t_{a} = t_{setup} +  t_{hold})
	Propagation delay: t_{pcq} = time after clock edge that the output Q is guaranteed to be stable (i.e., to stop changing). (These are different than prop and cont delay with logic gates as done before.)
	Contamination delay: t_{ccq} = time after clock edge that Q might be unstable (i.e., start changing) 


===== Setup Time Constraint (Tc): =====
	Depends on the maximum delay from register R1 through combinational logic to R2.
	The input to register R2 must be stable at least t_{setup} before clock edge.
	T_{c} ≥ t_{pcq} + t_{pd} + t_{setup}
	t_{pd} ≤ T_{c} – (t_{pcq} + t_{setup})

===== Hold Time Constraint: =====
	Depends on the minimum delay from register R1 through the combinational logic to R2.
	The input to register R2 must be stable for at least t_{hold} after the clock edge.
	if t_{ccq} + t_{cd} > t_{hold} then the delay is met. if it is not then add more gates (eg buffer)
