====== 7 - Numbers ======
Created Tuesday 09 February 2016

===== How to Manage Complexity: =====
	Abstraction (everything is "blocked" so that people can work on 1 level without worrying about the previous levels eg if your working on software you don't have to worry about logic gates)
	Discipline


==== The Three –Y’s: ====
	Hierarchy
	Modularity
	Regularity (Encouraging uniformity, so modules can be easily reused)


===== How Many Values Can I Represent With n Numbers In Decimal? =====
	How many values? 10^{N}
	Range?  [0, 10^{N} - 1]

Most Significant bit (MSb): the bit with the highest value (on the left)
Least Significant bit (LSb): the bit with the lowest value (on the right)

===== Overflow: =====
	When result is too big to fit in the available number of bits

Sign: [[Lectures:Assembly:2 - Assembly Language 2]]

===== Increasing Bit Width: =====
	Make the number have more bits in it.
	We do this in order for a number to fit properly 


==== Sign-extension: ====
	Add all the numbers to be the sign that the number has (copy the left most bit)


==== Zero-extension: ====
	Add zeros to the number (does not work with two's complement)
