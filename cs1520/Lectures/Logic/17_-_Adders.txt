Created Tuesday 15 March 2016


===== Half Adder: =====

===== Full Adder: =====

===== Multi-Bit Adders: =====
	Ripple-carry (slow): Time delay  t_{ripple} = N * t_{FA} where t_{FA} is the delay of a full adder and N the number of adders
	Carry-lookahead (fast): Carry-lookahead adders are faster for large adders but require more hardware.(Usually arranged in blocks of 4.)

	Same symbol as Full Adder but has /N at A B and S


===== How Carry-lookahead Works: =====
	The carry lookahead adder (CLA) solves the carry delay problem by calculating the carry signals in advance, based on the input signals.
	It is based on the fact that a carry signal will be generated in two cases:
	(1) when both bits A and B are 1, or
	(2) when one of the two bits is 1 and the Cin is 1.


For N-bit CLA with k-bit blocks the delay is: t_{CLA} = t_{pg} + t_{pg_block} + (N/k â€“ 1)*t_{AND_OR} + k*t_{FA}
t_{pg} : delay to generate all Pi, Gi
t_{pg_block} : delay to generate all Pi:j, Gi:j
t_{AND_OR} : delay from Cin to Cout of final
t_{FA}:  is the delay of a full adder
