===== Circuit Schematic Rules: =====
	Inputs on the left (or top) of a schematic.
	Outputs on right (or bottom) of a schematic.
	Whenever possible, gates flow from left to right.
	Straight wires are best
	Wires always connect at a T junction
	A dot where wires cross indicates a connection between the wires
	Wires crossing without a dot make no connection


===== Don't Cares: =====
	An output or input where we don't care if it is High or Low
	Marked with an X
	

===== Karnaugh Maps: =====
	A way to simplify a truth table in order to get the most simple equations.
	Useful for up to six variables
	{{./pasted_image.png?width=500}}


==== Rules: ====
	Every 1 must be circled at least once (it can be circled multiple times)
	Each circle must span a power of 2 (i.e. 1, 2, 4) adjacent squares in each direction
	Each circle must be as large as possible
	A circle may wrap around the edges
	A "don't care" (X) is circled only if it helps minimize the equation.


===== Illegal Value: X =====
	The symbol X indicates that the circuit node has an unknown or illegal value.
	Since X is also used for don't care, look at the context to decide what the X is


===== Floating Value: Z =====
	The symbol Z indicates a node is being driven neither HIGH nor LOW.
