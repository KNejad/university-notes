# 8 - Gates
Created Friday 12 February 2016

Boolean Constants:
------------------
These are '0' (false) and '1' (true)


Boolean Variables:
------------------
Variables that can only take the values '0' or '1'


Boolean Functions:
------------------
Each of the logic functions (such as AND, OR and NOT)

If both are True output is True
![](./8_-_Gates/pasted_image001.png)
If 1 of the 2 is True outputs True
![](./8_-_Gates/pasted_image002.png)
Negates its input value
![](./8_-_Gates/pasted_image003.png) 
Amplifies the signal and slows down a circuit.
![](./8_-_Gates/pasted_image004.png)
Outputs True if only 1 of the inputs is True
![](./8_-_Gates/pasted_image005.png)
Outputs True if any input is False
![](./8_-_Gates/pasted_image007.png)
Outputs True if the inputs are False
![](./8_-_Gates/pasted_image008.png)
Outputs True if the inputs are are the same


Noise Margin:
-------------
The area that is accepted as a 0 or a 1 (eg 0-2v=0b and 3.4-6=1b)

### Forbidden Zone:
Margin that is not accepted as either High or Low


### Static Discipline:
With logically valid inputs, every circuit element must produce logically valid outputs.
Use limited ranges of voltages to represent discrete values.
