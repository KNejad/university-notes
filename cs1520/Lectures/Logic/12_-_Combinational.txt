====== 12 - Combinational ======
Created Friday 26 February 2016

Outputs determined by values of inputs
No memory

===== Rules For Combinational Composition: =====
	Every element is combinational
	Every node is either an input or connects to exactly one output.
	The circuit contains no cyclic paths


===== Adders: =====

==== Half Adder: ====
	The sum can be found using the XOR operation and the carry using the AND operation.

==== Full Adder: ====
	We can change our half adder into to a full adder by including gates for processing the carry bit.

===== Decoders: =====
	Decoders are another important type of combinational circuit.
	Among other things, they are useful in selecting a memory location according to a binary value placed on the address lines of a memory bus.
	Address decoders with n inputs can select any of 2^{n} locations.

===== Multiplexer: =====
	A multiplexer does just the opposite of a decoder.
	It selects a single output from several inputs.
	The particular input chosen for output is determined by the value of the multiplexerâ€™s control lines.
	To be able to select among n inputs, log 2^{n} control lines are needed.
