====== 14 - Sequential 2 ======
Created Friday 04 March 2016

===== Latches: =====
	Any change on the inputs is seen at the outputs immediately when CLK=1.
	This causes synchronization problems.
	Solution: Use latches to create flip-flops that can respond (update) only at specific times (instead of any time).


===== Flip-Flop: =====
	Output only changes according to behaviour of clock edge.
	Also known as clocked devices.


==== D Flip-Flop: ====
	The fundamental circuit of computer memory. 
	Two inputs: CLK, D
	Edge-triggered: Samples D on rising edge of CLK (When CLK rises from 0 to 1, D passes through to Q. Otherwise, Q holds its previous value)

=== A D Flip-Flop is made of 2 D Latches: ===

==== Enabled Flip-Flop: ====
	Three inputs: CLK, D, EN
	EN = 1: D passes through to Q on the clock edge
	EN = 0: The flip-flop retains its previous state

==== Resettable Flip-Flop: ====
	Three inputs: CLK, D, Reset
	Reset = 1:  Q is forced to 0 
	Reset = 0:  flip-flop behaves as ordinary D flip-flop

=== Two types: ===
	Synchronous: resets at the clock edge only
	Asynchronous: resets immediately when Reset = 1


==== Settable Flip-Flops: ====
	Three inputs: CLK, D, Set
	Set = 1:  Q is set to 1 
	Set = 0:  The flip-flop behaves as ordinary D flip-flop

===== Finite State Machines: =====
	So far, our sequential circuit outputs have been limited to state variables (e.g. Q)
	In general, sequential circuits have outputs in addition to the state variable(s).


==== Two types (or models) of sequential circuits (FSMs): ====
	Mealy Machine: Output is a function of present state and present input
	Moore Machine: Output is a function of present state only


==== State Diagram: ====
	Describes a machine as a finite state machine 


=== Coin-Operated Turnstile State Diagram: ===
