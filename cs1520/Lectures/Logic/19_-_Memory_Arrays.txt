====== 19 - Memory Arrays ======
Created Tuesday 22 March 2016

===== N address bits and M data bits: =====
	2^{N} rows and M columns
	Depth: number of rows (number of words)
	Width: number of columns (size of word)
	Array size: depth * width = 2^{N}  *  M


===== Memory Array: =====
{{./pasted_image001.png}}

==== Bit Cell: ====
	{{./pasted_image.png}}
	To retrieve data from stored bit enable wordline (Set high) 
	Then read the value of the bitline.
	


===== Volatile Memory: =====
	Loses its data when power off
	Read and written quickly
	Main memory in your computer is RAM (DRAM)


===== Nonvolatile Memory: =====
	Retains data when power off
	Read quickly, but writing is impossible or slow
	Flash memory in cameras, thumb drives, and digital cameras are all ROMs


===== Types of Ram: =====

==== DRAM (Dynamic random access memory): ====
	Uses a capacitor
	{{./pasted_image003.png}}
	Dynamic because the value needs to be refreshed (rewritten) periodically and after read
	READ: data values are transferred from the capacitor to the bitline
	WRITE: data values are transferred from the bitline to the capacitor
	
	

==== SRAM (Static random access memory): ====
	Uses cross-coupled inverters
	{{./pasted_image002.png}}
	Value does not have to be refreshed
	Faster Than DRAM but more expensive 


===== Dot Notation: =====
	{{./pasted_image004.png}}

	A dot means that there is a 1 stored no dot means 0


===== Multi-ported Memories: =====
	{{./pasted_image006.png}}
	Port: address/data pair
	3-ported memory (can access several addresses simultaneously)
	2 read ports (A1/RD1, A2/RD2)
	1 write port (A3/WD3, WE3 enables writing)
	Port 1 reads the data from address A1 onto the read data output RD1
	Port 2 reads the data from address A2 onto the read data output RD2
	Port 3 writes the data from the write data input WD3 into address A3 on the rising edge of the clock if write enables WE3 is asserted


===== PLAs (Programmable logic arrays): =====
	{{./pasted_image005.png}}
	AND array followed by OR array
	Combinational logic only
	Fixed internal connections


===== FPGAs (Field programmable gate arrays): =====
	Array of Logic Elements (LEs)
	Combinational and sequential logic
	Programmable internal connections
