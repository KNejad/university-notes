===== Boolean Constants: =====
	These are '0' (false) and '1' (true)


===== Boolean Variables: =====
	Variables that can only take the values '0' or '1'


===== Boolean Functions: =====
	Each of the logic functions (such as AND, OR and NOT)

{{./pasted_image.png}}
If both are True output is True
{{./pasted_image001.png}}
If 1 of the 2 is True outputs True
{{./pasted_image002.png}}
Negates its input value
{{./pasted_image003.png}} 
Amplifies the signal and slows down a circuit.
{{./pasted_image004.png}}
Outputs True if only 1 of the inputs is True
{{./pasted_image005.png}}
Outputs True if any input is False
{{./pasted_image007.png}}
Outputs True if the inputs are False
{{./pasted_image008.png}}
Outputs True if the inputs are are the same


===== Noise Margin: =====
	The area that is accepted as a 0 or a 1 (eg 0-2v=0b and 3.4-6=1b)
	
{{./pasted_image009.png}}

==== Forbidden Zone: ====
	Margin that is not accepted as either High or Low


==== Static Discipline: ====
	With logically valid inputs, every circuit element must produce logically valid outputs.
	Use limited ranges of voltages to represent discrete values.
