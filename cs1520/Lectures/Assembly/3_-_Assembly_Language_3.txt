===== Bit Manipulation: =====
	Set bits (give them a value of 1)
	Clear bits (give them a value of 0)
	Complement bits (change 1 to 0, or 0 to 1)
	Manipulating bits is to make programs more efficient
	The program is smaller in size, required less RAM, or
	The program runs faster
	Reduce the storage by using individuals bits 
	Logical instructions: and, or, xor, not, test


===== Register V.S. Memory: =====
	Registers are temporary storage in the CPU that holds the data the processor is currently working on, while memory holds the program instructions and the data the program requires. 
	Data has to be loaded into a CPU register from memory before the CPU can process it. Memory is much slower than registers, the fastest operations work directly with registers. 
	There is a lot more memory than registers, there are generally only a few registers available on a processer, e.g., stack register, flags register, program counter, and some addressing registers.
