Using TASM assembly language.

===== DATA: =====
	All data goes in the .data part of the program
	charname db ‘y’  ;A character variable initialized to ‘y’
	stringname db ‘Enter the color:’, 0 ;A string, terminated by the NULL character
	numname dw 4000 ;num is 16 bit, initialized to 4000
	largename dd 80000 ;large is 32 bit, initialized to 80000
	i db 20 ;i  is initialized to 20
	k db ? ;k is undefined


===== Conditional Statements: =====
	cmp ax, bx ;compare ax and bx and store the result in compare flag
	je eq_lab ;if ax==bx, go to eq_lab


==== Jump Instructions: ====

===== Stacks: =====
	push ax;the value of ax stored on the stack
	pop ax;transfers the data from the top of the stack to ax


===== mathematical operations: =====
	mul bl ;multiply bl * al giving result in ax.
	div bl;divide ax by value in bl. result in al, remainder in ah
	add ax, 2 ;add 2 to the contents of ax
	sub ax,5 ;subtracts 5 from dxs
	shr ;shift the bits one step to the right 
	sar ;shift arithmetic right (keeps the sign)
	shl ; shift left
	dec dx ;decreases dx by 1
	inc dx ;increments dx by 1


===== Terminate Program: =====
	mov ax, 4c00h
	int 21h


===== Macros: =====
	CR equ 13
	samplemacro[parameter-list]
	;text (body) of macro may be one
	; or many lines
	endm


===== I/O Actions: =====
	MOV AH, 2                    ; carriage return
	MOV DL, 0DH          
	INT 21H

	MOV DL, 0AH                  ; line feed
	INT 21H

	MOV AH, 1                    ; read a character
	INT 21H

	MOV AH, 2                    ; display the character stored in CL   
	MOV DL, CL
	INT 21H


===== Graphical Mode: =====
	INT 10h ;switch between graphical mode and text mode
