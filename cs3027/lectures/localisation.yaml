_title: Localisation
_date: Sat 21 Oct 14:18:26 BST 2017
Odometry: Measure distance travelled by counting wheel rotations
Dead reckoning: Calculating the position based on the direction, distance travelled and initial position
Covariance: The degree at which to variables increase/decrease together. A negative covariance means the numbers move in opposite direction
Problems:
  - Some objects move
  - Sensors may be inaccurate
  - Open spaces make localisation difficult
  - Errors accumulate so the more the robot moves the further away it can be from where it thinks it is
Continuous representation: Scan continuously and decide where the robot is based on the surroundings
Topological representation: Map is represented as a graph
Occupancy grid:
  - Environment is a grid
  - Each cell is empty or filled
  - Cell values increment when something is detected in them
  - Cell values decrease if the robot goes through them
  - Cell past a threshold are marked as filled
