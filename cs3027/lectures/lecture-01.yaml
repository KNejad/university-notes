ros concepts:
  nodes: Running single purpose programs
  topics: Channels Nodes publish messages to or receive from by subscribing
  ros master: lists what services, nodes topics etc. are available
differential drive robot: A robot whose movement is based on two separately driven wheels placed on either side of the robot body
Instantaneous centre of rotation:
  Description: The point where the body is moving around (i.e. if it continues at its current velocity it will draw a circle around that point)
  Steps to calculate:
    - Get the direction any point is moving and draw a line at a 90 degree angle
    - Do this for another point (not parallel to the first point)
    - Where the points intersect is the ICR
Synchro drive robot: All wheels turn together
Admissible velocity space: The independent motions a robot has (i.e. turning in place, moving forward) notated by Î´_m
Differential degrees of freedom: The number of independent motions
Holonomic system: When all the degrees of freedom are controllable
Open loop control: The system does not get feedback on the effects of its actions
Proportional integral derivative controller: A control loop feedback mechanism which takes the error value into consideration
