Avoiding obstacles: Instead of taking the entire robot body into consideration, only take a central spot and inflate all obstacles by the amount needed for the robot to not collide
Path planning:
  Potential planning field:
    Description: Like a hill climbing heuristic. Grade each point and go to the immediately better point. This will not find the shortest path
    Steps:
      - The points on the map are marked with a number which represents the distance from the objective increasing exponentially the further away from the objective
      - Add to each point a number depending on how close it is to an obstacle and how close it is to the goal (less the closer to the goal)
      - The robot goes to the point next to it with the lowest grade at a speed proportional to the difference from the original point to the new point
      - Eventually the robot will smoothly stop at its destination
  Graph search:
    Description: Using a connectivity graph and a path finding algorithm. This will always find the shortest path
    Steps:
      - From the start point create another node at the edge of each visible obstacle/end point and an edge connecting the 2 with a value equal to the distance
      - Repeat for each connected node
      - Use a path finding algorithm to find the best way from start to finish
