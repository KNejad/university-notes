Gimbal locks: When 2 axis of rotation turn into 1 which causes the loss of a degree of freedom
Quaternions: A way of describing the orientation of an object and transforming the orientation
Euler angles: Similar to quaternions but easier to read and vulnerable to gimbal locks

Interpolation:
  Description:  The process of moving from 1 orientation to another
  Methods for quaternions:
    Spherical Linear Interpolation (slurp): Move x% closer to the target on each step
    _todo: Expand on the above
Quaternions dot product: Given 2 quaternions it will return how similar they are (with 1 being identical and -1 facing the opposite direction)
