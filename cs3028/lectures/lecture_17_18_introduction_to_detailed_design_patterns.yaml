Patterns:
  Creator: Responsible for creating another object
  Information expert: Responsible for a set of tasks and has all the information about them. This can allow other objects to use this one without knowing the details of the domain
  Controller: Gathers the data sent to the user interface layer
  Pure fabrication: An object which does not represent anything in the business domain and solves a set of cohesive problems
  Indirection: Helps 2 other objects communicate
  Protected variations: If something returns unstable results this method can be used to stabilise them first
  Adapter: If 2 or more objects have an incompatible interface this can create a bridge between them
  Factory: Creates many other objects of a different type when there can be variations in the way they are made
  Singleton: An object that can only have a single instance of itself
  Strategy: Create multiple polymorphic objects which can handle a situation, then another object is responsible for deciding which method is best used for each scenario
  Composite: With a group of different objects that need to be accessed, they should inherit from a common ancestor so that they have a common interface
  Facade: A single point of contact for a subsystem with a common interface so that other objects don't have to interface directly with each object in the subsystem
  Observer: Subscribers which get notified when publishers publish a message
