Modularity principles:
  - Small
  - As few dependencies on other modules as possible (low coupling)
  - Only do one thing (high cohesion)
  - Given the least privilege necessary
  - Encapsulation
Design outcome:
  - Modularity decisions
  - System states
  - Responsibilities for each module
  - Interfaces and communication protocols
  - Non functional requirements met by each unit
  - Dependencies
