Black box: Ignores the internals of the system and treats it like a black box, only checking that the output is correct for certain inputs
White box: Focuses on the internal structure of the system and tests every piece of code
Unit testing: Testing individual units like packages, classes, methods etc.
Integration testing: Tests how different units work together
Equivalence partitioning: Split the possible inputs into logical groups. For example something which accepts any integer can be split into positive integers and negative integers
Boundary values: The edge inputs for a function. For example if something accepts a positive integer then 1 and the maximum possible integer are boundaries
Flow graphs: A method can have multiple different branches based on the inputs. A flow graph represents all of these possible branches
Cyclomatic complexity: Refers to the number of independent paths in a graph
Regression testing: Testing old features
Validation testing: Testing that the requirements are met
