Architectures:
  Opened layer: Each layer can call any layer below it
  Closed layer: Each layer can only call the layer directly below it
  Hexagonal: The business logic is in the centre and anything else that needs to connect uses an adapter which is surrounding the business layer
  Pipe and filter: Like the unix model. Each part takes input from the previous and does something to the data which is output and taken from the next part
