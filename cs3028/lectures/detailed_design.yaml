Levels of coupling (best to worst):
  None: No coupling
  Data: The data from a method is to perform the action
  Stamp: Only some of the information passed is needed
  Control: The data returned controls the execution of the caller
  Global: Method refers to global data
  Content: Refers to a hidden part of another object
Levels of cohesion (from best to worst):
  Functional: A method performs one single function
  Sequential: A method performs two functions, where the output from the 1st one is used as the input to the 2nd one
  Communication: The method combines two functions that use the same attributes
  Procedural: The method supports multiple weakly related functions
  Coincidental: no correlation between method functions
