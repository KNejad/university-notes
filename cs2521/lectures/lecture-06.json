	"Types of graphs": {
		"Simple": "No multi-edges or loops",
		"Sparse": "Only a small fraction of vertex pairs",
		"Acyclic": "No cycles",
		"Disconnected": "Not fully connected",
		"Directed/undirected": "Edges are one way or two way",
		"Embedded": "Geometric position of vertices and edges have meaning",
		"Implicit/explicit": "Graph is fully represented, or conceptual",
		"Labelled/unlabelled": "Each vertex is associated with a unique identifier or it has no identifier"

	"Adjacency matrix": "A 2D array to represent a graph",
	"Adjacency list": "A collection of lists used to represent a graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a vertex in the graph",
	"Degree": "The number of edges entering a vertex plus the number of edges leaving",
	"Free tree": "An acyclic, connected undirected graph",
	"Forest":  "A set of free trees"
