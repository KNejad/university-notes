		"Structure": "The first index stores the root, index 2 stores the left hand child, 3 stores the right, etc.",
		"min-heap": "The minimum element is on top",
		"max-heap": "The maximum element is on top"
	},
	"Merge": "Takes multiple sorted lists as input and produce a single sorted list as output,",
	"Merge Sort": "Divide the list into the smallest unit (1 element), then recursively merge each list. Finally all the elements are sorted and merged.",
	"Quick sort": {
		"Randomized quick sort": "Same algorithm as quick sort but it shuffles the inputs before hand for security reasons (so that malicious people can't slow down your system)"
	},
	"Decision tree": "A full binary tree that represents the comparisons between elements that are performed by a sorting algorithm"
