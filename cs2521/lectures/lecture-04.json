	"Heap": {
		"Description": "A heap is a data structure that efficiently supports priority queue operations insert, find-min or max and delete-min or max",
		"Structure": "The first index stores the root, index 2 stores the left hand child, 3 stores the right, etc.",
		"min-heap": "The minimum element is on top",
		"max-heap": "The maximum element is on top",
		"Operation complexity": {
			"Find min": "Θ(1)",
			"Delete min": "Θ(log n)",
			"Insert": "O(log n)"
		}
	},
	"Merge": "Takes multiple sorted lists as input and produce a single sorted list as output,",
	"Merge Sort": "Divide the list into the smallest unit (1 element), then recursively merge each list. Finally all the elements are sorted and merged.",
	"Quick sort": {
		"Steps": [
			"Pick an element, called a pivot (usually the right most element), from the array.",
			"Reorder the array so that all elements with values less than the pivot come before the pivot, and all larger after the pivot (equal values can go either way)",
			"Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-arrays"
		],
		"Randomized quick sort": "Same algorithm as quick sort but it shuffles the inputs first in order to reduce chances of a bad pivot being picked"
	},
	"Decision tree": "A full binary tree that represents the comparisons between elements that are performed by a sorting algorithm"
}
