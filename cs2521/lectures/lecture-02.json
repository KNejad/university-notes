			"We usually assume a single processor computer with infinite RAM",

			"Definition": "Ignores the differences between multiplication of powers (i.e. 2n^5 is the same as 3n^5)",
			"Dominating term": "The term in an equation which determines the approximate value (i.e. in n^2 + n^3 the n^3 is the dominating term)",
			"Upper bound": "The maximum time an algorithm might take. Denoted by O(g(dominant term))",
			"Lower bound": "The minimum time an algorithm might take. Denoted by Ω(g(dominant term))",

	"Heuristic": "Tries to find a good result to a problem but (unlike an algorithm) it does not guarantee the best solution"
