_title: Algorithmic Problem Solving
_date: Mon Jan 16 15:00:00 GMT 2017
Description: This course provides the knowledge needed to understand, design and compare
  algorithms.  By the end of the course, a student should be able to create or adapt
  algorithms to solve problems, determine an algorithm's efficiency, and be able to
  implement it. The course also introduces the student to a variety of widely used
  algorithms and algorithm creation techniques, applicable to a range of domains.
  The course will introduce students to concepts such as pseudo-code and computational
  complexity, and make use of proof techniques as well as the studentâ€™s programming
  skills.
