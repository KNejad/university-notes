Here is where I place all of my university notes from my studies at The University of Aberdeen. 
Unfortunatelly all notes from my first semester were lost so those will not be included (thanks OneNote and OneDrive)

All notes from 2016 are markdown files generated by zim desktop wiki.
All other notes are yaml files.
