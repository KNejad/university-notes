# university-notes

Here is where I place all of my university notes from my studies at The University of Aberdeen. 
Unfortunatelly all notes from my first semester were lost so those will not be included. 

All notes from 2016 are HTML files generated by zim desktop wiki.
All other notes are json files 

To view the files go to knejad.github.io/university-notes/

Add titles.sh (as json-titles) to path (cp titles.sh /bin/json-titles) so that you can get a list of titles in all sub-directories of your current directory by typing json-titles
