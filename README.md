# university-notes

Here is where I place all of my university notes from my studies at The University of Aberdeen. 
Unfortunatelly all notes from my first semester were lost so those will not be included. <br>

All notes are in plain text and notes for courses are in the corresponding directory named after the course code. For a better viewing experience use Zim Desktop Wiki to view the files
