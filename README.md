Here is where I place all of my university notes from my studies at The University of Aberdeen. 
Unfortunatelly all notes from my first semester were lost so those will not be included. <br>

All notes from 2016 are HTML files generated by zim desktop wiki.<br>
All other notes are json files <br>

To view the files go to knejad.github.io/university-notes/
