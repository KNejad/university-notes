Attributes:
  - Symbolic, with no numbers
  - Structural though incomplete
Problems with rule based reasoning:
  - Reasoning from first principals
  - Dangers with nearest approximation
Model: A set of knowledges which are fed into an inference engine in order to make predictions
Scales of measurement:
  - Nominal
  - Ordinal
  - Interval
  - Ratio
Components:
  - Ontology
  - Variables
  - Quantity space: Values variables take
  - Relations
Continuous:
  - No gaps
  - No jump
Discontinuous/discrete:
  - Finite number of gaps
  - Jumps can occur
Envisionment:
  Description: Results of inference
  Types:
    - Total: All possible behaviours known for all possible inputs
    - Complete: All possible behaviours known for a specific inputs
    - Attainable: All behaviours for a specific initial value and input with a fixed quantity space are known
    - Partial: All behaviour from a specified initial value and input with landmark generation are known
  Behaviour: A single path through an environment
  History: behaviour of a single variable outside of the context of the envisionment
Intermediate value theorem: States that for a continuous system values moving from positive to negative (and the reverse) must pass through 0
Cascaded Systems: A system using derivatives to map the rate of flow from one container to another
