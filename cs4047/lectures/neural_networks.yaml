Biological neural networks:
  Nerve cells: Basic component of a neural network
  Synapses: Sends signals across neurons
Artificial neural network elements:
  - Inputs
  - Weights
  - Bias
  - Activation function
  - Output
Gradient descent:
  Description: A method of minimizing error in a network and finding a local minima
  Steps:
    - Define an objective error function
    - Pick initial set of weights randomly
    - Evaluate  errors
    - Update all the weights as w_new = w_old - learning_rate * gradient_vector
Benefits of each layer:
  1st layer: Draws linear boundaries
  2nd layer: Combines the boundaries
  3rd layer: Can generate arbitrarily complex boundary shapes
Backpropagation:
  Description: Allows updating the weights for neurons on each layer
  Credit assignment problem: How do we blame/credit certain neurons for the result we get
  Phases:
    Forward pass:
      Description: Compute the output for all the nodes
    Backward pass:
      Description: Compute the error and propagate the error backwards through the network
      Steps:
        - Calculate the difference between the real result and expected result
        - Multiply that with the result given by each output of the previous layer (this is the delta)
        - Update each weight as w_i = learning_rate * delta
