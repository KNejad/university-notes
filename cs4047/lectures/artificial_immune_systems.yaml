Applications:
  - Clustering
  - Anomaly detection
  - Computer security
  - Optimisation
Affinity:
  Description: Essentially a distance measure
  Types:
    - Hamming: Count the number of changes required (e.g. "coal" is 1 distance from "goal")
    - Euclidean: The distance between 2 points as the crow flies
    - Manhattan: The distance between 2 points measured as right angles
    - R-contiguous bits rule: The maximum number of bits in a row which are different
Algorithms:
  - Bone marrow models
  - Clonal selection:
      Steps:
        - Create a random population
        - Repeat many times for each pattern in the data set:
          - Compare its affinity with each member of the population
          - Create clones proportional to their effectiveness
          - Mutate the clones. The more effective clones should mutate more
          - Kill off some of the weak old members
  - Negative selection: Create a set of detectors which fail to match strings output by the correctly functioning system. If any ever do match then the system has deviated
