Neighbourhood strategies:
  - Geographical: Neighbours are all in the same area
  - Social: Neighbours are all determined from the beginning and they stay in a single neighbourhood
Swap sequence: In problems like TSP, the solutions are represented as a list of locations to visit. The swap sequence determines which 2 elements will swap location
Basic swap sequence:
  Description: The number of swaps needed to swap from the personal best to the global best solution found so far
  Calculating: For each element, swap it with the element which should be in that elements index
