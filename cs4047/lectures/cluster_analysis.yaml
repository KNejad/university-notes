Hierarchical clusters: A set of nested clusters
Partitional clusters: A division of data into separate groups
Cluster types:
  - Well-separated: Any point in a cluster is closer to all other points in its cluster than in any points in other clusters
  - Center-based: Any point in a cluster is closer to the centre of its cluster than the other
  - Contiguous: Any point is closer to one or more points in the same cluster than any points in another cluster
  - Density based: A cluster is a dense region of space separated by a less dense region of space around it
  - Conceptual: All points share a common property or concept
  - Objective function: Finds clusters which minimize or maximize an objective function
Algorithms:
  - K-means:
      Steps: |
        Select K points as the initial centroids
        repeat
          Form K clusters by assigning all points to the closest centroid
          Recompute the centroid of each cluster
        until The centroids don't change
      Variants:
        - K-means++: Similar to K-means but select initial points which are far away from each other (with probability of selecting each point relative to the distance to other clusters)
        - Bisecting K-means: Creates partitional clusters by dividing existing clusters
  - Hierarchical:
      Description: Creates a "parent" cluster around an existing cluster and the closest point not yet in a cluster
      Variants:
        - Agglomerative: Start as each point as a cluster and build up from there
        - Divisive: Start with one large cluster and create sub clusters
      Methods:
        - Minimum point distances
        - Maximum point distances
        - Group average
        - Wards Method: Merge based on which join of clusters will result in the lowest sum of squares error increase between members within a cluster
  - Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise:
      Point types:
        - Core: Any point which has more than a certain number of points in a given radius
        - Border: In the neighbourhood of a core point
        - Noise: Any point which isn't a noise or a core point
      Steps:
        - Eliminate all noise points
        - For each core point, if it doesn't already have a label, give it and all its neighbouring points a label, repeat for all newly labelled points
Evaluation of clusters:
  - External index: Check how well the clustering worked based on externally supplied labels
  - Internal index:
      Methods:
        - Silhouette coefficient:
            - Calculate average distance between a selected point and other points in its cluster (a)
            - Calculate average distance to i from points in all other clusters
            - Pick the cluster with the smallest average distance (b)
            - Compute (b - a)/max(a,b)
            - Closer to 0 the better
  - Relative index: Compare against other clustering methods
