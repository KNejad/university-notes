Assumption-based truth maintenance system:
  Description: A system where truths are known about the world and assumptions are made in order to deduce more possible facts
  Node:
    Attributes:
      - Premises: Facts about the world
      - Assumptions: We make assumptions about the world so we can infer more information
      - Justifications: Justifications about the conclusions we have just made
  Error diagnosis steps:
    - Given that something is wrong, create a set of what things cannot possibly all be working together
    - From that you can work out what sets of items could possibly be broken
DUNAMIS:
  Steps:
    - Assumes everything is working
    - When something is broken it divides into groups of what must be working for a certain component to function as well as  the groups of things which could be broken for a certain component to not work
    - Work out what things must be broken by removing things from the blame set (if they are things on the set which can work)
    - What remains is likely what's causing the problem
