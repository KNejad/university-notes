_title: Practical 6 - Abstract Data Types
_date: Mon Feb 27 11:43:06 GMT 2017
Preliminaries: This is a summary of the definition of the QueueOfIntegers class in
  Java that is provided with the practical – a queue operates in a first-in-first-out
  (FIFO) manner. You are provided will a complete class definition for QueueOfIntegers,
  plus a couple of useful exception classes and a class “UseIntegerQueue” that you
  can run to interact with an instance of the QueueOfIntegers class.
_file: practical-06/preliminaries.java
'1':
  Task: Download and compile the code. Note that because UseIntegerQueue.java depends
    on the other classes, you just need to compile this one.
  Solution:
    Command: javac UseIntegerQueue.java
'2':
  Task: Run the UseIntegerQueue program and interact with your queue. Check things
    such as bad data entry and attempts to insert an integer into a full queue and
    satisfy yourself that you understand how this works.
  Solution:
    Command: java UseIntegerQueue
'3':
  Task: 'Generalise the QueueOfIntegers class definition so that queues of various
    lengths can be created. Hint: you need a new constructor method.'
  Solution:
    _file: practical-06/QueueOfIntegers.java
'4':
  Task: 'Create a parameterized class Queue (defined in file “Queue.java”) that can
    manage queues containing any object type. Hint: see lecture slide on “Parameterized
    Classes in Java 5.0”.'
  Solution:
    _file: practical-06/Queue.java
'5':
  Task: 'Adapt UseIntegerQueue so that it uses your new parameterized class. Hint:
    all you should need to do is change the declaration of “thequeue”.'
  Solution:
    _file: practical-06/UseIntegerQueue.java
'6':
  Task: Create a class UseStringQueue, based on UseIntegerQueue to interact with a
    queue of String.
  Solution:
    _file: practical-06/UseStringQueue.java
