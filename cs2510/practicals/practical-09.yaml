'1':
  Task: Represent in Prolog a database of records containing a staff number, a staff
    name, and the salary. Consider using a list to simulate a database of records,
    and store this database as a fact “database([...])”.
  Solution: ''
'2':
  Task: Using your database of the previous item, write a Prolog program to give everyone
    an increase of X% (where X is an input) in their salaries. Your solution will
    take as an input parameter the existing database and the X% increase value, and
    generate an updated list as an output parameter.
  Solution: ''
'3':
  Task: Using your database of item 1, write a Prolog program which, given a list
    of staff numbers, removes these from the database. Your program should be similar
    to the one of the previous item in that it takes as an input parameter the current
    database, a list of staff numbers, and produces as an output parameter the updated
    database. Make sure your solution can handle non-existing staff numbers.
  Solution: ''
'4':
  Task: Using your database of item 1, write a Prolog program to count the number
    of staff receiving more than a given salary value.
  Solution: ''
'5':
  Task: Using your database of item 1, write a Prolog program which, given a range
    of staff numbers (the smallest and the highest value), creates a list with those
    staff records within these two values.
  Solution: ''
'6':
  Task: 'Using your database of item 1, write a Prolog program to give an increase
    of X% to all staff below a given salary value. Hint: re-use the answers to items
    2) and 4).'
  Solution: ''
'7':
  Task: 'Using your database of item 1, write a Prolog program to give an increase
    of X% to all staff within a range of staff numbers. Hint: re-use the answers to
    items 2) and 5).'
  Solution: ''
'8':
  Task: 'Pretty print the database of item 1, with a header for columns, and up to
    20 records per “page” (before another header is printed). '
  Solution: ''
