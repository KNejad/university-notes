_title: Data Types
_date: Thu Feb  2 15:07:13 GMT 2017
_note: Nothing very new here. Just different types of data
Fixed stack-dynamic: Allocation is done at declaration time
Heterogeneous arrays: Elements in the array can be different types (i.e. mixture of
  integers and strings)
Associative arrays: Unordered collection of key value pairs (Like hashes in Ruby or
  dictionaries in Python)
