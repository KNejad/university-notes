Evaluation criteria:
- Readability
- Writability
- Reliability
- Cost
Orthogonality: A small set of primitive constructs can be combined in every possible
  way
Fetch-execute-cycle:
  Definition: The set of steps a CPU follows to execute instructions on a program
  Steps:
  - Fetch the instruction pointed to by the counter
  - Increment counter
  - Decode instruction
  - Execute instruction
Language categories:
  Imperative:
    Definition: Functions can change the system state
    Languages:
    - C
    - Java
  Functional:
    Definition: The only effect of a function is its return value
    Languages:
    - Haskell
    - LISP
  Logic:
    Definition: A set of sentences in logical form, expressing facts and rules about
      some problem domain
    Languages:
    - Prolog
Implementation Methods:
  Compilation: Programs are compiled into machine language
  Interpretation: Programs are interpreted by another program
  Hybrid: The source code is translated into a format which is easier to interpret
Compilation Phases:
  Lexical analysis: Converts the source code into a sequence of tokens
  Syntactical analysis: Analyses the source code, to check whether it  conforms to
    the rules of the language
  Semantic analysis: Gather necessary semantic information from the source code
  Code generation: Generates the machine code
Von Neumann Bottleneck: The connection speed between a computerâ€™s memory and its processor
  throttles the speed of the computer
Just-in-time implementation systems: A type of hybrid implementation method where
  the parts of the code are compiled when needed
Preprocessor macros: Instructions executed before compilation which are commonly used
  to specify that code from another file is to be included
