1: Ensuring that only a specific user can decrypt messages and verifying the integrity and authenticity of messages
2: It is not as computationally efficient as symmetric cryptography
3:
  e: A prime number
  P: A large prime number
  q: A large prime number
  φ(n): (p-1)(q-1)
  d: (1 % φ(n))/e
  Encryption: message^e % n
  Decryption: cipher_text^d % n
4: Because d is calculated by dividing with e. This means that d will be larger with a smaller e. It could be an advantage if the server encrypts a lot of data and clients decrypt. This is because a client can handle decrypting a single message with a large e
