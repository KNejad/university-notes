3 factors of authentication:
  - Something you know
  - Something you have
  - Something you are
Strong authentication: Using more than one proof (possibly of the same type)
Multi-factor authentication: Using more than one proof but of a different factor
Time-of-check to time-of-use: The authentication time doesn't have to be at the same time as usage
Soft authentication: Asking users whether their activity in the past was suspicious, asking them not to do something they aren't allowed to do (without actually preventing them) etcetera
Mutual authentication: Both the server and the client must authenticate each other
Non-repudation: When it isn't possible for agents to deny their actions
AAA framework:
  - Authentication
  - Authorization
  - Accountability
