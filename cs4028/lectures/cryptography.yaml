Cipher: An algorithm combined with a key to encrypt data
Block cipher:
  Description: Encrypt block by block
  Modern block ciphers:
    - DES
    - AES
    - IDEA
Stream cipher: Encrypt as a stream
Frequency attack: Decipher an encrypted message by analysing which characters appear most often in the cipher text
Ciphers:
  - Mono alphabetic substitution cipher
  - Polyalphabetic stream cipher
Shannon's principles of confusion and diffusion:
  Confusion: The relationship between key and ciphertext should be complex
  Diffusion: The relationship between plaintext and ciphertext should be complex
One time pad: Use a key which is at least as long as the message so there are no repetitions. This way no frequency attacks can happen
Trapdoor function: A function for which the inverse can be computed only with a secret key
Discrete logarithm problem: A computationally hard problem which is the foundation of many encryptions. Namely, it is hard to compute x given g^x
Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange:
  Description: A method for two parties to securely exchange keys
  Steps:
    - Both parties agree on a public large prime number and small integer (p, g)
    - Each party generates a large secret integer (a,b)
    - Each party performs a calculation with the above data. The result is the public key (A = g^a mod p) (same for B)
    - Using the public key and the secret integer, each party can calculate the same private key (k = A^b mod p)
