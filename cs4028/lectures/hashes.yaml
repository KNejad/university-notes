Pre-image: The source of a hash function
Pre-image resistant: It's hard to find what input produced a certain hash
2nd pre-image resistant: It's hard to find another input to produce the same hash given a value and its hash
Collision resistant: It should be hard to find any two inputs which produce the same hash
One way hash functions:
  Properties:
    - Pre-image resistant
    - Fast to compute
  Applications:
    - Integrity check
    - Authentication
Avalanche effect: A small change in the input should produce a hash which is on average 50% different than the original hash
Iterated hash functions: Split the input and hash each block along with the output of the previous blocks hash
Keyed hash function: A hash function which also requires a secret key which is concatenated to the hash
