Verifiability: The ability for a third party to verify disputes about whether a document was signed, without having to see the private key
Non-repudiation: The signer cannot claim they didn't sign a document
Authenticity: Nobody else can pretend to sign a document
Signature attack types:
  - Existential forgery: Can forge a signature for at least 1 message
  - Selective forgery: Can sign a signature for a particular message chosen up front
  - Total break: Can sign any any message
Key-only attack: Only the public key is known
Message attack:
  Description: Given some information, trying to work out the key
  Types:
    - Known-message attack: Has signatures for some messages
    - Chosen message attack: The ability to generate any messages
    - Adaptive chosen message attack: An attacker can produce signatures for any message using enough past signed messages
RSA Problem: How can you perform private key operations with only the public key Weak RSA assumption: It is assumed that you cannot brute force signatures
Properties of a good signature scheme:
  - Authentic
  - Unforgeable
  - Not reusable
  - Unalterable
  - Non-repudiable
