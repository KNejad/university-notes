Identity federation: Using credentials from another organisation to gain access (e.g. sign in with Google feature)
Discretionary access control: Define an owner for each resource. Control is at the discretion of the owner
Mandatory access control: A system wide policy grants access
Group: A collection of users who share a set of permissions. Permissions change frequently
Role: A set of permissions for a given period of time. Multiple users can share a role. Permissions change infrequently
Identity-based access control: Access is granted based on the users identities
Attribute-based access control: Access is granted based on the users attributes
Implementations of access control:
  - Capabilities: For each subject, keep a list of its access rights
  - Access control lists: For each object, keep a list of the access rights to it
Windows access control model:
  Access tokens: Contain information about a logged-on user. Every process which executes on behalf of the user will have this token
  Security identifiers: Contains privileges over OS resources and tasks. They are linked to a user
  Security descriptors: Contain the security information that protects a securable object.
  System access control list: Controls how the system audits attempts to access an object
  AccessCheck: Checks if a discretionary access control list exists for a resource, if it does not it grants access. Otherwise it assesses the DACL from top to bottom and grants permission if appropriate
  Mandatory Integrity Control: Low privileges granted to downloaded files
  Dynamic Access Control: Allows admins to specify access controls
