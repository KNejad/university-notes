==== WEEK 4: 5 October: ====

==== WEEK 5: 12 October: ====
	Tutorial: ‘Living in a Multi-Faith Public’ Students should arrive at the tutorial with an example of a mode of inter-faith engagement; be able to explain the theory  behind it; give a concrete example of its working in practice; and evaluate its effectiveness. Discussion will revolve around the most effective ways of engaging in inter-faith dialogue.


==== WEEK 6: 19 October: ====
