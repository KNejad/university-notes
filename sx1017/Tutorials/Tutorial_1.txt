	Does Religion Cause Violence?
	Behind the common question lies a morass of unclear thinking.
	William T. Cavanaugh

===== Religion cant be defined so you can't say religion is more violent that secularism: =====

==== My Response: ====
	Many things can't be easily defined. This does not make the label useless. Here the label of religion is being used to put Islam Christianity Buddhism Hinduism and more into one category. If we replaced the word "religion" in an article with "Islam Christianity Buddhism Hinduism... " The article is still equally valid.
	

===== Nationalism is a lot like religion and it is very violent: =====

==== My Response: ====
	Does the argument "Knifes also kill people so guns are good" make any sense to you?
