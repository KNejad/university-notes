Task
Please speed read the attached case (in file below) -- skim parts that seem less relevant and focus on parts that seem most relevant; read the questions first in order to know what information you are skimming for. Prepare some notes to discuss the following questions in tutorial:


1) What kind of beliefs are protected by the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)?

2) Unlike the ECHR, the Constitution of the United States protects only religious beliefs. Should a state give stronger protection to religious beliefs than non-religious ones?

3) The ECHR protects not only religious beliefs, but also the manifestations of such beliefs.  According to your opinion, what constitutes manifestation of a belief? Eg. X uses corporal punishment to discipline his children. (“He who spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves him is diligent to discipline him”: Proverbs 13:24.) Is it a manifestation of a belief?

4) What was the official uniform in the school? In what process was it approved? Why was Shabina Begum unhappy to wear the school uniform? What are the arguments for having a school uniform?

5) According to the ECHR, the right to manifest religious beliefs is not absolute. The restriction on religious freedom is legal, if the interference is justified. According to the judges of the House of Lords, did the school uniform rule interfere with Shabina Begum’s right? Why or why not? How does the European Court of Human Rights interpret the term interference? Is this interpretation convincing?

6) In order to be legal, the interference with someone’s freedom of religion must be ‘necessary in a democratic society.” What made the interference necessary according to the judges?

7) Explain how the context of the case (secondary education) influenced the decision?
