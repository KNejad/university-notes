Created Wednesday 05 October 2016

Lecturer: Professor Christopher Brittain

===== Definition Public Sphere: =====
	We call events and occasions “public” when they are open to all, in contrast to closed or exclusive affairs (Jürgen Habermas)
	It is the common world that gathers us together and yet prevents our falling over each other (Hannah Arendt)


===== Separation of Church and State: =====
	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof
	Thus building a wall of separation between Church & State

In France Politicians though not technically prohibited from making religious remarks, mostly refrain from it

Lecturer seems to be against the burqa ban in France and not allowing people to wear religious symbols/clothes.

The church of England has automatic representation in the house of lords. Can visit schools and many more benefits.

===== John Rawls: =====

==== Overlapping Consensus: ====
	By using overlapping consensus it is possible for there to exist over time a just, stable society of free and equal citizens, who remain profoundly divided by reasonable religious, philosophical and moral doctrines? 
	Different private reasons for achieving the same conclusion
	But our interactions solely in terms of ‘public reason’


==== Criticism: ====
	Appears to suggest that religion is the primary source of confusion and violence in the political sphere
	Does not attend to the most basic reasons people have for acting  (but all must translate these 'thick' reasons into 'thin' public reason)
	
===== Jürgen Habermas: =====
	Religious citizens appear more motivated by moral issues
	
===== Talal  Asad: =====
	Private/public distinction a Western (Protestant Christian) idea
