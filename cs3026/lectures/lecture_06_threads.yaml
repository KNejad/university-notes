User level threads:
  - Can only use a single core
  - Light thread switching because kernel mode switch is not necessary
  - We can implement our own thread scheduling
  - Blocking one thread blocks all
Kernel level threads:
  - Can take advantage of multiple cores/cpus
  - Needs to switch kernel mode which is expensive
Hybrid user kernel level threads: Can take advantage of the benefits of each of both user and kernel level threads
join(): Wait for all threads to finish and then join to a single thread
