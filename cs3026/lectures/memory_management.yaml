Program memory address location: A programs memory location is offset relative to its start location. This allows easy relocation of the program in memory
Internal fragmentation: If a partition is larger than the memory contained, some memory will be wasted
External fragmentation: If a partition is too small for any memory to fit inside it, memory will be wasted
Buddy system: Solves the problem of memory waste due to fragmentation by splitting the partitions into halves until the partition size is very close to the required memory
Translation look-aside buffer: A hardware cache to improve memory lookup speeds
Principle of locality: References to memory locations within a program tend to cluster
Page: A fixed sized chunk of memory. This can be moved in and out of RAM as a single unit
Frame: Physical memory is divided into frames
Page fault: When a page which is required is not in memory so it has to be fetched from the HDD
Resident set: The set of pages that can be in main memory per process at a specific time
Thrashing: When a process is repeatedly page faulting
Localities: A set of pages which are often required together
Page replacement:
  Description: When no physical frames are free, a frame needs to be removed to make space for a new one
  Policies:
    - Optimal policy: Not possible without looking into the future. Used as a benchmark for the best policy
    - Least recently used: Replace the page which has not been referenced for the longest amount of time. Whilst this returns good results it can be quite slow
    - First-in-first-out: Replace the oldest page
    - Second chance: Similar to FIFO but if a frame has been recently used it is moved to the end of the replacement queue
    - Clock algorithm:
        Description: A faster implementation of the Second change policy.
        Process:
          - To allocate a new page check each frame in a list starting from the frame after the last checked frame. If the "use" bit is 1 then set it to 0 and check the next frame. If the "use" bit is 0 then use that frame.
          - When a frame is used we set the "use" bit to 1.
