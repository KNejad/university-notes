Program memory address location: A programs memory location is offset relative to its start location. This allows easy relocation of the program in memory
Internal fragmentation: If a partition is larger than the memory contained some memory will be wasted
External fragmentation: If a partition is too small for any memory to fit inside it memory will be wasted
Buddy system: Solves the problem of memory waste due to fragmentation by splitting the partitions into halfs until the partition size is very close to the required memory
Translation lookaside buffer: A hardware cache to improve memory lookup speeds
Pricinciple of locality: References to memory locations within a program tend to cluster
Page: A fixed sized chunk of memory. This can be moved in and out of RAM as a single unit
Page fault: When a page which is required it not in memory so it has to be fetched from the HDD
Resident set: The set of pages that can be in main memory per process at a specific time
Thrashing: When a process is repeatedly page faulting
Localities: A set of pages which are often required together
