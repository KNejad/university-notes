ACID principles:
  Atomicity: Each action is atomic, meaning there can be no partial commits
  Consistency: A transaction must tranform the system from one consistent state to another
  Isolation: An incomplete transaction should not reveal its intermidiate state until it's complete
  Durability: Once a transaction is commited it must persist on the system
