Threat tree: A tree representing the goals of an attacker where the leaf nodes represent possible ways to achieve the sub goal
Substitution ciphers: replace plain text symbols with corresponding cipher-text symbols
Transposition ciphers:
  Description: reorder plain text symbols within the cipher-text
  Types:
    Columnar transposition: Create a column for each letter of the secret. Reorder the columns alphabetically then serialise the text column wise
    Mono-alphabetic substitution:
      Description: Each symbol is substituted by another symbol (always the same) in ciphertext (e.g. "x" always becomes "y")
      Types:
        Caesar Cipher: Each character is substituted by the character N letters to the right of it, where N is the key
        Polygrams: Instead of substituting single characters substitutes multiple together
        Homophonic: Letters map to more than one symbol
      Frequency analysis: By analysing the frequency that certain characters occur it is possible to decipher the text
    Poly-alphabetic substitution: Use multiple mono-alphabetic ciphers
  One time pad: A key which can only be used once
Block ciphers: Encode the plain text in a block-wise fashion
Stream ciphers: Encode the plain text in a bit-wise fashion
Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange:
  Description: A method for two parties to securely exchange keys
  Steps:
    - Both parties agree on a public large prime number and small integer
    - Each party generates a large secret integer
    - Each party performs a calculation with the above data. The result is the public key
    - Using the public key and the secret integer, each party can calculate the same private key
Avalanche effect: The slightest change in a message should completely change the ciphertext
Shannon's principles of confusion and diffusion:
  Confusion: The relationship between key and ciphertext should be complex
  Diffusion: The relationship between plaintext and ciphertext should be complex
Feistel network:
  Description: A complex encryption algorithm which follows Shannon's principles
  Steps:
    - Apply a function to the right half of the input block
    - XOR the result with the left side
    - Swap the left side with the right side
    - Repeat everything N times, each with a different key
Digital Encryption Standard: Uses similar processes to Feistel network but also undoes some of the work done in the beginning
Relative prime: Two integers are relatively prime, if their greatest common divisor is 1
RSA:
  Description: Asymmetric encryption algorithm
  Private key: d = (1 mod (prime_a-1)(prime_b-1))/e
  Public key: The product of the two primes (n); Also a relative prime number to (prime_a-1)(prime_b-1) (e)
  Encryption: M^e mod n
  Decryption: C^d mod n
