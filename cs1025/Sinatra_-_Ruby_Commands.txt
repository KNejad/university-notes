Keyboard Input: gets
Get variables from Post request: Params(:VariableName)

Add layout to view: create a file in the views dir called layout.erb with <%= yield %> at the end. This will be added as the view for your erb files.

===== Variable Format: =====
	Local:   My_var = "dave"
	Object: @My_var = "dave"
	Class: @@My_var = "dave"
	Global: $My_var = "dave"


===== Basic Code Structure: =====
	get '/directory' do
		#Code Here
	end

	Replace get with post for a post request
	
	

===== Object Oriented Programming: =====
	Ruby natively supports OOP;
	
	class classname
		#code
		
		def initialize(param1, param2)
			@info = param1
		end
	end


==== Inheritance: ====
	Classes can inherite other classes with the < sign
	
	class classname < inheritedclass
			def initialize(param1, param2, param3)
			super(param1,  param2) #calls the parent class
				@extra_info = param3
			end
	end
