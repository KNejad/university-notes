# 06 - Writing Applications
Created Sun Nov 27 2016

Top Down Approach:
------------------
Start from the top (function name) and end at the bottom (implementing the most detailed parts)
	
Bottom Up Approach:
-------------------
Start by creating the smaller parts of the application and then integrate them into the bigger parts
	
DRY: Dont Repeat Yourself:
--------------------------
Put any repeated code in functions or loops
