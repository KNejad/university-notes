===== What is Sinatra? =====
	Sinatra is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for quickly creating web-applications in Ruby.
	It ties specific URL directly to relevant Ruby code and returns its output in response. 
	It does not integrate 100s of helpers like frameworks such as Rails.
	Applications tend to be created as a single file.
	Ideal for small clearly-defined web services and proof of concept prototypes.
