====== 09 - Normalization ======
Created Tuesday 11 October 2016


===== Unnormalized Form (UNF): =====
	A table that contains one or more repeating groups.
	To create an unnormalized table: transform data from information source (e.g. form) into table format with columns and rows.


===== First Normal Form (1NF); =====
	A relation in which intersection of each row and column contains one and only one value.


===== Second Normal Form (2NF): =====

==== Based on concept of full functional dependency: ====
	A and B are attributes of a relation R, 
	B is fully dependent on A (denoted A->B) if B is functionally dependent on A but not on any proper subset of A.
	
	A relation that is in 1NF and every non-primary-key attribute is fully functionally dependent on the primary key.


===== Third Normal Form (3NF): =====


==== Based on concept of transitive dependency: ====
	A, B and C are attributes of a relation such that if A -> B and B -> C, 
	then C is transitively dependent on A through B.  (Provided that A is not functionally dependent on B or C).

	  A relation that is in 1NF and 2NF and in which no non-primary-key attribute is transitively dependent on the primary key.
