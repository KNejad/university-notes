IEF: Integrity Enhancement Features

===== Domains: =====
	Domains are data types (VARCHAR FLOAT TIME etc)
	

==== User Defined Domains: ====
	Domains can be created by the user with the CREATE DOMAIN command


=== Example: ===
	CREATE DOMAIN SexType AS CHAR(1)
	DEFAULT 'M'
	CHECK (VALUE IN ('M', 'F'));


===== Scalar Functions: =====
	Scalar functions convert/manipulate data values (ie. SUBTEXT)


===== Referential Integrity: =====
	If a foreign key is non-null, it must match an existing row in the parent table.
	SQL will reject operations that would violate referential integrity
	

===== Constraints: =====
	Constraints prevent tables from having certain characteristics (ie A member of staff may manage no more than 100 properties) 
	

===== Example: =====
	CREATE ASSERTION StaffNotOverLoaded
	CHECK (NOT EXISTS
	(SELECT StaffNo FROM PropertyForRent
	GROUP BY StaffNo HAVING COUNT (*) > 100));
	CREATE TABLE PropertyForRent ( ...
	CONSTRAINT StaffNotOverLoaded); 


===== Triggers: =====
	Triggers are ways of the database doing something if something happens.


===== Schemas: =====
	A schema is a collection of named DBMS objects (ie Tables, Domains, Views etc)
