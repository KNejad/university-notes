====== 17 - Query Processing ======
Created Tuesday November 8 2016

===== Query Processing Operations: =====
	Syntax Analysis: transform SQL into an internal form
	Normalisation: Rewrites the WHERE and AND and OR predicates into disjunctine or conjunctive form (see relational algebra) 
	Semantic analysis: Checks if the query is valid (whether it makes sense)
	Simplification: Remove redundant parts
	Generating execution plan:  Query optimisation
	Executing plan and returning results to client


==== Steps In Lexical And Syntactical Analysis: ====
	Identify keywords
	Identify table names & aliases
	Map aliases to table names
	Identify column names
	Check if columns exist


===== Relational Algebra: =====
	A symbolic formal way of describing relational operations
	Says how, as well as what (order is important)
	Can use re-write rules to simplify and optimise complex queries


==== RA Notaion: ====
	Selection: σ
	Projection: π
	Rename: ρ
	Cartesian product: x
	union: U
	intersection: ∩
	conjunction (AND): Λ
	disjunction (OR): V
	negation (NOT): ~
	Natural Join: ⋈


==== Operations SQL Equivalent: ====
	Selection: WHERE
	Projection: SELECT
	Rename: AS


==== SQL Queries in RA: ====
	SELECT name FROM staff: π name (staff)
	SELECT name FROM staff AS user: ρ user (name) π name (staff)
	SELECT name FROM staff where  salary =1: π name σ salary=1 (staff)


==== Relational Algebra Tree (RAT): ====
	The output of the syntactical analysis
