Aggregate functions compute summarization (or aggregation) of data

===== Aggregate functions: =====
	SUM
	AVG
	MIN
	MAX
	COUNT


===== Count(*): =====
	Counts the number of rows in a table


===== Group By: =====
	Aggregate functions help us to summarise the whole column(s) of data into one row.
	Sometimes we want to group data before applying aggregate functions
	This gives us ‘subtotals’ rather than ‘overall total’
	GROUP BY is used to achieve that


===== Having: =====
	Like "where" clause
	"where" clause introduces a condition on individual rows; having clause introduces a condition on aggregations


===== Combining Results: =====
	Union: Combine rows from both queries
	Intersect: Keep only rows in common of both queries
	Except: Only keep rows from first query which are not in the second query
