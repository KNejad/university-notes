====== Tutorial 02 ======
Created Thursday 29 September 2016

===== 1) Describe in words the languages accepted by each of the following FSAs: =====

==== i) ====
	{{./pasted_image.png}}
	
	Accepts a strings 0s and 1s with an even number of 0s


==== ii) ====
	{{./pasted_image001.png}}
	Accepts a sting of 0s and 1s starting with "10" and not containing "00"


==== iii) ====
	{{./pasted_image002.png}}
	Accepts a sting of 0s and 1s containing "00" or "11"


===== 2) Give a formal definition for the FSAs which define the following languages (i.e. specify Q, I, F, T, E): =====

==== (i) strings containing a or ab {a, b} ====
	Q = 1, 2
	I  = 1
	F = 2
	T = a , b
	E = {1,a,2}, {2,a,2}, {2,b,2}

==== (ii) strings containing aba or bab {a, b} ====
	Q = 1, 2, 3 , 4 ,5 ,6
	I  = 1
	F = 4
	T = a , b
	E = {1,a,2}, {1,b,5}, {2,a,2}, {2.b,3}, {3,a,4}, {3,b,5}, {4,a,4},{4,b,4}, {5,a,6}, {5,b,5}, {6,a,2}, {6,b,4}

==== (iii) strings containing exactly one a (and any number of bs) or exactly one b (and any number of as) {a, b} ====
	Q = 1,2,3,4
	I = 1
	F = 3, 4
	T = a,b
	E = {1,a,3}, {1,b,4}, {2,a,2}, {2,b,2}, {3, a,2}, {3,b,3}, {4,a,2},{4,b,2}


==== (iv) strings containing a, ab or abc {a, b, c} ====
	Q = 1, 2
	I  = 1
	F = 2
	T = a , b
	E = {1,a,2}, {2,a,2}, {2,b,2}
	
==== (v) strings containing a, ba or cba {a, b, c} ====
	Q = 1, 2
	I  = 1
	F = 2
	T = a , b
	E = {1,a,2}, {2,a,2}, {2,b,2}
	


===== 3) Give a formal definition for a FSA accepting the infinite set of strings representing numbers divisible by 2. (i.e. 0,2,4,6,8,10,12,....) =====
	Just check the last digit, make sure itâ€™s even (need two states)
	Let E=0,2,4,6,8
	Let O=1,3,5,7,9
	Then QIFTE=({1,2},{1},{2},{O,E},{(1,O,1),(1,E,2),(2,O,1),(2,E,2)})
