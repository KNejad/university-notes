===== Deterministic: =====
	No possible input that does not have an output
	

===== Regular Expressions: =====
	Let T be an alphabet. A regular expression over T defines a language over T as follows:
	(i) λ denotes {λ}, φ denotes {}, t denotes {t} for t ∈ T;
	(ii) if r and s are regular expressions denoting languages R and S, then
		(r + s) denoting R + S,
		(rs) denoting RS, and
		(r*) denoting R* are regular expressions;
	(iii) nothing else is a regular expression over T.
	A language L (over T) is a regular language (over T) if there is a regular expression denoting it.	


==== Example: ====
	a* (b + c + d) = A sequence of 0 or more a, followed by b or c or d
