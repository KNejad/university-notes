Created Tuesday 04 October 2016

A language is a set of strings over an alphabet.

===== Languages serve two purposes in computing: =====
	Communicating instructions or information
	Defining valid communications


===== Grammar: =====
	A set of production rules for strings in a formal language.
	Grammars are 4-tuples consisting of Non Terminals (N), Terminals (T), Start Symbols (S) and Productions (P)
	Non Terminals: A finite alphabet (ie X, Y, Z)
	Terminals: Characters which cannot be substituted further (ie a, b, c)
	Start Symbols: The initial symbol to produce the alphabet with (ie X) 
	Productions: Available substitutions for characters to create stirngs (ie X -> aX: This means that X can be substituted by aX in our language)


===== Context-free Grammar (CFG): =====
	The left side of all production rules are non terminal (ie a -> b instead of X -> b)
	CFGs produce Context-free Languages (CFL)
