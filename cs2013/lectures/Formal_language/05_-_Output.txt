Created Tuesday 04 October 2016

===== Moore Machines: =====
	A finite-state machine whose output values are determined solely by its current state. 
	6-tuple (Q,I,T,E,Γ,O)
	Γ is the output alphabet
	O is a set of pairs (a function : Q → Γ) defining the output corresponding to each state of the machine.
	The output is shown in the state bubble


===== Mealy Machines: =====
	A finite-state machine whose output values are determined both by its current state and the current inputs.
	6-tuple (Q,I,T,E,Γ,O)
	Γ is the output alphabet
	O is a set of pairs (a function : Q → Γ) defining the output corresponding to each state of the machine.
	The input and output are shown on transition line
	
A mealy machine can be converted to a moore machine and the reverse

===== Other Variations: =====
	Markov models: FSAs whose edges have probabilities 
	Hidden Markov models: FSAs with hidden edges
