===== Bayesian Reasoning: =====
	Estimating probability of a hypothesis H
	Given evidence E (thatâ€™s H|E),
	Based on P(E|H) and P(H)


==== Example: ====
	E: Mary is very bright
	H1: Mary becomes an astronaut
	H2: Mary becomes a school teacher
	P(E|H1) > P(E|H2) but P(H2) >> P(H1) (Since she is bright there is a higher chance of being an astronaut. Since the chances of her being an astronaut is so low (very few people are astronauts). She  is probably a teacher)
	H2 will tend to be the better explanation
