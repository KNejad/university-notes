# 03 - First Order Predicate Logic 3
Created Monday 17 October 2016

Equality:
---------
Equality can be used in predicate logic 
	

### Example:
∀x∀y (( P(x) ∧ P(y)) → x= y ) 
Meaning: there exists at most one object with property P
All X with property P are equal to all of y with property P (so no x can be different)
	

Vacuous Truth:
--------------
A statement that asserts that all members of the empty set have a certain property.


Decidability:
-------------
If a problem has a method that always gives you the correct answer in finite time the problem is decidable
