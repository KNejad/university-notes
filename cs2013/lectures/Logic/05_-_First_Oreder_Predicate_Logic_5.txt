===== Satisfiabiity: =====
	A formula p is satisfiable iff it has a model
	A set S of formulas is satisfiable iff there is a model M such that for all p in S, M is a model of p


===== Compactness Theorem: =====
	If all finite subsets of a set S of FOPL formulas are satisfiable then S itself is satisfiable.
