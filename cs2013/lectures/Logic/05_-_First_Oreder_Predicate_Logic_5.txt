Created Monday 24 October 2016


===== Model: =====
	A model is a universe of discourse (D) and a interpritation function (I)
	Universe of Discourse: D = {John, Mary} means that the u.d contains John and Mary
	Interpretations: I(j) = John  means that j gets interprated as John


===== Satisfiabiity: =====
	A formula p is satisfiable iff it has a model
	A set S of formulas is satisfiable iff there is a model M such that for all p in S, M is a model of p: Meaning that if a model (M) covers all formulas (p) in a set (S) then the set is satisfiable


===== Compactness Theorem: =====
	If all finite subsets of a set S of FOPL formulas are satisfiable then S itself is satisfiable.
