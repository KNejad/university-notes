# 01 - First Order Predicate Logic
Created Monday 10 October 2016

Predicate Logic is an extension of propositional logic with quantifiers.

Quantifiers:
------------
Quantifiers are used to say "Exists" (∃) and "For All" (∀) 


Universe of Discourse (UD):
---------------------------
The values that a variable can have


First and Second Place Predicate:
---------------------------------
1 Place Predicate: F(x)
2 Place Predicate: F(x,y)

∀xP(x) is a formula because X is a formula so P(x) is an atomic formula and then ∀x is a quantifier so ∀xP(x) is a formula

Free and Bound Variables:
-------------------------
An expression like P(x) is said to have a free variable x (i.e., x is not “defined”).
A quantifier binds one or more variables, to produce an expression having one or more bound variables.

φ (x:=a) is the result of substituting all FREE occurrences of the variable x in φ by the constant a
