====== Logic ======
Created Tuesday 04 October 2016

Atoms: Letters corresponding with true false sentances 

Complex propositions: Built up from multiple atoms using operators (ie Λ) 

operands: subject of a mathematical expression

===== Operators: =====
	combines operands into a larger statement
	

==== Unary: ====
	Only 1 operands
	ie NOT
	

==== Binary: ====
 
	2 operands
	ie AND 
	

===== Tautologies: =====
	A proposition which is true regardless of the atomic propositions


===== Contradictions: =====
	A proposition which is false regardless of the atomic propositions


===== Contingencies: =====
	A proposition whose truth value is determened by the value of the atomic propositions (ie all propositions which are not tautologies or contradictions)
	

===== Logial Equivalence: =====
	Two different statements which represent the same meaning
	Notation: ⇔



===== Implication Operator: =====
	Says that x implies y  
	Notation: x → y
	The first atom is the antecedent
	The second atom is the consequent
	If x is true then y is true.
	if x is false y could be either
	The statement is false only if the antecedent is true and the consequent is false
	

===== Biconditional: =====
	Both operands have the same truth value
	Notation: <->:
