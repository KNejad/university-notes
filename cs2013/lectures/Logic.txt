====== Logic ======
Created Tuesday 04 October 2016

Atoms: Letters corresponding with true false sentances 

Complex propositions: Built up from multiple atoms using operators (ie Λ) 

operands: subject of a mathematical expression

===== Operators: =====
	combines operands into a larger statement
	

==== Unary: ====
	Only 1 operands
	ie NOT
	

==== Binary: ====
	2 operands
	ie AND 
	

===== Tautologies: =====
	A proposition which is true regardless of the atomic propositions


===== Contradictions: =====
	A proposition which is false regardless of the atomic propositions


===== Contingencies: =====
	A proposition whose truth value is determened by the value of the atomic propositions (ie all propositions which are not tautologies or contradictions)
	

===== Logial Equivalence: =====
	Two different statements which represent the same meaning
	Notation: ⇔



===== Implication Operator: =====
	Says that x implies y  
	Notation: x → y
	The first atom is the antecedent
	The second atom is the consequent
	If x is true then y is true.
	if x is false y could be either
	The statement is false only if the antecedent is true and the consequent is false
	

===== Biconditional: =====
	Both operands have the same truth value
	Notation: <-> 
	

===== Equivelence Laws: =====
	Identity: p Λ T ⇔ p
	Domination:  p Λ F ⇔ F
	Idempotence: p V p  ⇔ p
	Double Negation: ¬¬p ⇔ p
	Commutativity: p V q ⇔ q V p
	Associativity: (p V q) V a ⇔ p V (q V a)
	Distributed: p V (q Λ r) ⇔ (p V q) Λ (p V r)
	De Morgans Law: ¬(pΛq) ⇔ ¬p V ¬q
